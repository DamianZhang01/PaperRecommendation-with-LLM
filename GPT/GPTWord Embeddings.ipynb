Filter fundamental features are: multi-selectivity, highlight actions,\\nresponsive element, and wrapper methods that aggregate key performance indicators. Filter\\nmethods prioritize intrinsic feature properties, embedded methods integrate\\nselection within the training process, and wrapper methods evaluate features\\nbased on model performance, catering to diverse modeling approaches.

The plateaus of the Hall conductance are described by\\nHecke eigensheaves of the geometric Langlands correspondence. Especially, the\\nparticle-vortex duality, which is explained by S-duality of Chern-Simons\\ntheory, corresponds to the Langlands duality in Wilson and Hecke operators.\\nMoreover the Langlands duality in the quantum group associated with the\\nHamiltonian describes fractal energy spectrum structure, know as Hofstadter's\\nbutterfly.
